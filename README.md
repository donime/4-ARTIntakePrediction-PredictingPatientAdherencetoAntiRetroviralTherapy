# ART Intake Prediction
In the healthcare industry, understanding patient adherence to treatment is important for efective patient management. This illustrates the necessity for predictive models that can show patient behaviors and anticipate responses to therapies. This project proposes the development of a predictive model tailored to predict patient adherence to Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART). By delving into patient reactions and identifying influential factors, this model aims to provide insights for the healthcare industry to understand key factors in patient interreaction to ART management. 

# Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains null values which were appropriately dealt with. Insight into the proportion of null values is crucial as having above 50% null values in the dataset can skew outcomes limiting the applicability of the work done by the model.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Some valuable insight on factors affecting patient adherence to ART treatment was generated, these insights can have applicability when developing other predictive models for other chronic ailments where adhenrence also plays a keep role in good outcomes.

Understanding adherence to treatment can help personalize healthcare in modern-day medicine, and training predictive models in machine learning is one of the key ways to go.
